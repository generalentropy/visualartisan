I've come up with the idea of starting a series of articles on programming, specifically aimed at addressing the questions I encountered as a beginner on my JavaScript journey

This includes things that might seem evident or trivial, but are not so obvious for a beginner.

Sometimes, knowing how to use things is sufficient, but there are people who feel frustrated when they don't fully understand how these things work. Because of this lack of understanding, they often find themselves stuck. I am one of these people

These articles are the result of all my personal notes that I've compiled over months.

This blog also serves as a my online knowledge base.

I'm convinced, as a learner myself, that some of these posts may be of great help to you if you're just starting to learn JavaScript in 2023/2024 and have no prior programming experience.
